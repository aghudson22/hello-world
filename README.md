Hello world!

This represents my first foray into using GitHub for any kind of project! I've done 
some programming, but never at the level of a full project. My work has primarily 
consisted of MATLAB, some light Python or R, and only enough code to solve the particular 
problem I had at the time. This is a big jump!
